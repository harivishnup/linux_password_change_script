# linux_password_change_script
Linux change initial or expired password in multiple servers

# background
When a user receive the first time login password from Linux administrator, the default password is set to something and forces the user to change that password.
1 server is ok, 2 is fine, how ahout 100s or 1000s of servers?

This script can help there, tt can store the old and new passwords and loop through each server form a list and reset initial/expired password on every server

#Requirement
A server with expect command installed in it.
